# Gemini API Key Configuration
#
# This app uses Google's Gemini API for AI-powered features:
# - Smart filter recommendations based on time of day
# - AI skin analysis and personalized filter suggestions based on your appearance
#
# ========================================
# How to Get Your FREE API Key
# ========================================
#
# 1. Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys
# 2. Sign in with your Google account
# 3. Click "Create API Key"
# 4. Copy the generated key
#
# ========================================
# Setup Instructions
# ========================================
#
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to .env (remove .example)
#    Command: cp .env.example .env
#
# 2. Replace 'your_gemini_api_key_here' below with your actual API key
#
# 3. Restart your development server
#    Command: npm start
#
# ========================================
# Security Best Practices
# ========================================
#
# ✓ The .env file is in .gitignore (won't be committed to Git)
# ✓ Never share your API key publicly
# ✓ Never commit .env to version control
# ✓ Regenerate your key if accidentally exposed
#
# ========================================
# Educational Notes
# ========================================
#
# We use GEMINI_API_KEY (without REACT_APP_ prefix) for simplicity and
# direct naming. This is cleaner and more intuitive for learners.
#
# Access in code:
#   const apiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY;
#
# Learn more about environment variables:
